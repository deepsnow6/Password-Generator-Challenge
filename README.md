# Password-Generator-Challenge

# Link to live apllication 

## Project Description

This is a javascript application that generates secure passwords based on user-selected criteria. It offers a variety of user selected criteria options like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Motivation: My goal was to create a password generator that uses a variety of random characters,  so users can generate secure passwords. This application can help users protect their online security and prevent things like identity theft. As a cybersecurity major, I can't emphasize the importance of good password etiquette enough. 

What I learned:  I worked mainly with JavaScript and practiced using conditional statements and loops to prompt users for input and  generate random passwords based on user-selected criteria. This code functions in conjunction with prewritten HTML and CSS in the starter code. 

Problem Solved: By modifying the starter code I was ale to produce a functional live password generator. You can choose the length of the password, and the type of characters to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). This is so you can customize your preference of password complexity. 

## Features 

The password generator allows users to:

Select the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters)
Choose to include lowercase letters
Choose to include uppercase letters
Choose to include numbers
Choose to include special characters

## Installation 

1. Open the Github repository: https://github.com/deepsnow6/Portfolio-website.

2. Select "Download ZIP" from the "Code" menu to download the project files in a compressed ZIP folder locally.

3. Unzip said file and extract the contents of the folder.

4. Launch the "index.html" file in the browser of your choice.

## Usage 

To use the password generator,  open the index.html file live link in your preferred web browser. There is a "Generate Password" button that you can click to generate a new password.

When you click on the button, you will be prompted to enter the desired password length between 8 and 128 characters. If you enter an invalid length, you will receive an error message and be asked to enter a valid length.

After entering the desired length, you will be asked to choose which types of characters you want to include in your password, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

Once you have specified the desired criteria, the generator will create a new password and display it in the "Your Secure Password" box.
